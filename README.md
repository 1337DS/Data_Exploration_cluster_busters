# Data-Exploration Project "Skin-Cancer" WWI19DSB
## Goal of the Project
This Project is about analyzing Data based on the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham1000) and creating a model that will predict the correct type of skin cancer.

## Installation instructions 
1. Install requirements.txt  **updaten**
2. Download Dataset **Einfügen**
3. run jupyter notebook 

## Project Results
The Project Results are presented in a Jupyter Notebook. In the beginning there is a basic overview over the data. After that the data is pre-processed to learn models on it. The next part is training Neural Networks. The vary in different structures and size. At last the results of the models is shown in a small report of different measurements.
