# Data-Exploration Project "Skin-Cancer" WWI19DSB
## Goal of the Project
This Project is about analyzing Data based on the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000) and creating a model that will predict the correct type of skin cancer. The files for the models can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o_JC-wZeNbwXNIH9eW53mpVD1Z1mGZeM?usp=sharing).

## Installation instructions 
1. Install requirements.txt  **updaten**
2. Download Dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000) and Model Data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)
3. run jupyter notebook 

## Project Results
The Project Results are presented in a Jupyter Notebook. In the beginning there is a basic overview over the data. After that the data is pre-processed to learn models on it. The next part is training Neural Networks. The vary in different structures and size. At last the results of the models is shown in a small report of different measurements.
